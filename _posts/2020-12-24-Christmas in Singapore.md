The Christmas this year is special. We are in Singapore and waiting for the coming of brand new 2021. Coral will have her visa interview next Monday. Wish everything goes well in 2021!

This is my first github page post. It's a good start!

Moreover, I'd like to practice with Leetcode to improve my coding skills.

Merry Christmas!
